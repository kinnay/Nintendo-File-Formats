This file is identified by the magic number `MsgFlwBn`. The format holds flowcharts.

| Type | Description |

| `FLW3` | [Nodes](#flw3-block) |
| `FEN1` | [Flowchart Labels](#fen1-block) |
| `REF1` | ? |

## FLW3 Block
This section holds all the [nodes](#nodes).

| Offset | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x0 | 2  | Node count |
| 0x2 | 2  | Branch table ID count |
| 0x4 | 12 | Padding |
| 0x10 | 16 per node | [Nodes](#nodes)
| | 2 per ID | [Branch table](#branch-table) |
| | | [String table](#string-table)

### Nodes
Actions defined within the FLW3 Section are done via nodes. 

| Offset | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x0 | 1 | [Node type](#node-types) |
| 0x1 | 1|  [Parameter type](#parameter-types) (Only for [Branch Nodes](#branch-node) and [Event Nodes](#event-node))|
| 0x2 | 2 | Reserved |
| 0x4 | 4 | Parameter value |
| 0x6 | 8 | Node data |

#### Node Types
| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [Message](#message-node) | Prompts a message from a MSBT file |
| 2 | [Branch](#branch-node) | Branches to a different node depending on a specific condition. |
| 3 | [Event](#event-node) | Executes a specific action or game event. | 
| 4 | [Entry](#entry-node) | Node that acts as a starting point for a flowchart |
| 5 | [Jump](#jump-node) | Jumps  to a different flowchart |

#### Parameter Types
Parameter types dictate how parameter values may be passed into the node if it takes arguments. There may be more than one value passed into a node.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 4 byte integer |
| 1 | Pair of 2 byte integers |
| 2 | Unknown | 
| 3 | Unknown |
| 4 | Unknown |
| 5 | String value. Stored as an offset from start of block to the string in the [string table](#string-table) |
| 6 | 4 byte integer |

### Message Node
| Offset | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x2 | 2 | Next node index |
| 0x4 | 2 | [MSBT](msbt.md) file index |
| 0x6 | 2 | Message index into [TXT2](msbt.md#txt2-block) |
| 0x8 | 2 | Unused |

### Branch Node 
| Offset | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x2 | 2 | `0xFFFF`|
| 0x4 | 2 | Node Identifier |
| 0x6 | 2 | Branch table case count |
| 0x8 | 2 | Starting index into the branch table |

### Event Node
| Offset | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x2 | 2 | Next node index |
| 0x4 | 2 | Node identifier |
| 0x6 | 4 | Unused |

The node identifier allows a game to link the node to a specific action or condition. 

### Entry Node
| Offset | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x2 | 2 | Next node index |
| 0x4 | 6 | Unused |

### Jump Node
| Offset | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x2 | 2 | Next flowchart |
| 0x4 | 6 | Unused |

The next node index when marked as `0xFFFF` is the end of a flowchart unless it is a branch node. The next node for a jump node must refer to the Entry node of another flowchart.

### Branch Table
Nodes that are branch will jump to a specifc case based on a condition. These function like Switch statements.

| Offset | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x0 || List of node IDs |

### String Table 
| Offset | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x0 || List of strings | 

## FEN1 Block
This block contains the flowchart [labels](overview.md#hash-tables). The index of a flowchart is the location of its Entry [node](#nodes).
