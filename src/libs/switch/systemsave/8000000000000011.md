This archive is mounted to `idgen:/` by the account sysmodule.

It contains a single file: `/context.bin`.

It has the following format:

| Offset | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x0 | 24 | Base time ([SteadyClockTimePoint](../general.md#nntimesteadyclocktimepoint)) |
| 0x18 | 8 | Last update time (seconds since base time) |
| 0x20 | 4 | Last update time fraction (measured in \\(\\frac 1 {10^7}\\) seconds) |
| 0x24 | 2 | Sequence number |
| 0x26 | 2 | Padding |
| 0x28 | 8 | Device id |

All values are encoded in little-endian byte order.

If multiple updates are performed within a second, the last update time fraction is incremented, instead of being regenerated.

If this is not possible, because the fraction is `9999999`, the base time is reset and the sequence number is incremented. Otherwise, the sequence number remains unchanged.

The device id is generated once, when the save file is created. It is based on the SHA-1 hash of 16 random bytes, the serial number, and the MAC address of the Nintendo Switch. The upper two bytes are always cleared. The lowest bit is always set.

The initial value of the sequence number is based on the same hash as the device id.
