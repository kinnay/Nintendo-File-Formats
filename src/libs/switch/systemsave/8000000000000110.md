This archive is mounted to `npns_save:/` by the `npns` sysmodule. It contains save data for Nintendo's push notification service.

The save data archive contains two files:
* `persistent.bin`
* [`penne_persistent.bin`](#penne_persistentbin)

The first file stores save data for Nintendo's old push notification system (NPNS). This was used up to system version 17.0.1.

The second file stores save data for Nintendo's new push notification system (Penne). This was introduced in system version 18.0.0.
