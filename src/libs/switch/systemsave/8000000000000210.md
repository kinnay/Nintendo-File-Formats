This file is mounted to `dauth:/` by the account sysmodule.

It contains three files:
* `/caches/aauth_authtoken`
* `/caches/dauth_authtoken`
* `/caches/dauth_edgetoken`

These files contain cached tokens from the [device authentication](https://github.com/kinnay/NintendoClients/wiki/DAuth-Server) and [application authentication](github.com/kinnay/NintendoClients/wiki/AAuth-Server) servers.

Every file provides room for a fixed number of tokens. The remaining space is filled with null bytes. For auth tokens, 2048 bytes are reserved per token. For edge tokens, 1024 bytes are reserved per token.

The following table shows the number of tokens that can be cached (`N`), the number of bytes that are reserved per token (`S`), and the total size of each cache file (`T`):

| Filename | N | S | T |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `aauth_authtoken` | 4 | 2048 | 8 KB |
| `dauth_authtoken` | 32 | 2048 | 64 KB |
| `dauth_edgetoken` | 32 | 1024 | 32 KB |
